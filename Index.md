Development strategies and sessions:
One of the most important aspects or base component for reaching that agility on software development, is that it relies on continuous integration and continuous delivery, but if we go one step before there are many things that needs to be on place for being able to reach an effective process.

And that relais in having an effective Agile Development, a well defined strategy that needs to warranty the next items:
Granularity: For being able to decompose business user stories into a granular lebel tech user stories.
Test oriented approach: For  warranting there with not blocking on external dependencies and Pipe lines for having inmediatamente results about development test quality.
Code “Done”: Being able to finish a piece of code which is 100% tested and highly covered.

For reaching that effectiveness on our Agile Development, we will relay our strategy on the next sessions and activities:
User story decomposition: As we know Enterprise agility trends to serve user stories with a heavy business approach, and we we define this as a business user stories. And that is perfectly okay because those user stories will come always boots for work from the business side then landing on the pro tour openers pray managers and a scrum Masters, and up to that point we are merely talking about business needs.

But even in those scenarios would a business user story is correctly granular, it's cool means of a considerable are for for converting Need into a piece of software.

And this is when we introduced the concept of Tech user stories, which will translate in the compulsion a business need or many breathable and technically understandable user stories.

This decomposition is really important because that will help to dissipate any possible ambiguity on the business user story and translate it to a technical language that any engineer could understand and immediately start working on.

For given more clear escenario we will bring the sample of the business need of having a login page:

Test design sessions: This is the immediate next step after reaching the Tech user stories decomposition, and as the name explained by itself, in this session the engineer next to layout the scenarios for effectively and almost completely testing the the piece of code we need to deliver.

Where are advice in to follow the next type of test and guidelines for laying out the scenarios:
Write meaningful test scenarios, this is something really quick to explain I am we cool highlight one sample:
Instead of saying: "When passing True it must return the data".
We could Cómo with a more meaningful readeble scenario by saying: "When user asks for details, it must return the account number".
Unit Testing, where are every class Indy code it will need to have one or many that's sweet that guarantees that Java class is reaching almost 100% coverage.
Integration testing, the engineer most layout the desert scenarios that the warranties the code is correctly integrated with other components.
Integration testing for external dependencies or services, the engineer next to layout all the test scenarios that guarantees the code is correctly integrated while consuming third-party services. And for the sake of avoiding dependencies that blocks continuous development:
Is highly recommended to you smoking frameworks for bypassing that dependency.
Also is highly recommended to use loca or on memory databases providing external dependencies of remote databases.
Business compliance testing, the engineer next to lay out all the scenarios that warranties the business needs are in compliance, en satisfies The acceptance criteria stated in the business user stories.

Test design document: The engineer will deliver a document containing a table like layout gathering all the test scenarios.
Test-driven development: Bla bla bla.
Code review session: besides doing all the coke cleaning go send text and call readability activities we often do on code review, where incorporating one step that Will guarantee is code is test review with at the same time.

For this purpose the code review worse will use the test design document asagai line for certifying the piece of code is in compliance with all the level of test. But mainly a most important at all Nicole review will be in capacity ofvalidating if the piece of cold is in in compliance with the business needs. This is why is so important to have the "Business compliance testing" as part of the test design session.

Team Building (Breaking the ice):
The most difficult stopper for bypass is the lack of participation on an Agile Process, for that we are comming with the next sessions and activities for helping improve participation and finally braking the ice.

Daily geek pills: Is a short session that we could use for allowing team members to talk and expose topics around technology itself. The Main principle we follow up with this is, "Let's allow engineers to feel in it's own comfort zone", in a more precise way, giving some space to engineers to talk about what they love.
The benefits of this session are:
Team members we'll talk about technology which is what they love.
Members that often doesn't talk a lot on Enterprise meetings we'll have the opportunity to be listen and to break the ice slowly.
The idea is to have one or two minutes per every engineers that wants to talk about some technology topic for example: new products coming to Market, new versions or releases of some piece of technology, or for example Microsoft is buying Skype or Facebook is buying WhatsApp.
It doesn't need to have everybody talking, but daily having two or three guys sharing in these sessions will definitely help to build the team, and will help people to break the ice. Also people will have interest in doing some research previously for having a point to talk for next session.
Rotated Anchor: As we know Enterprise agility is heavily based on Waterfall practices, for example maintaining hierarchical roles. What we are looking for with this "Rotated" initiative is to break down a little that hierarchical sense, and making feel everybody is on the same level, by allowing everybody to have the opportunity to drive simple sessions like stand up and retrospective.
The idea of this initiative is to give the opportunity to a different team member to drive the daily stand up, and in the retro session it could do the same thing.
That will pump up the team member spirit and will help folks to demonstrate their organizational and leadership skills.
Lunch and learn's: This is widely adopted session adapted across so many different agile methodologies. The idea is to have every one or two Fridays and we're not a one hour session at the team level and having one or two forks folks that's a wheel exposed and percent any technology topic they want to share, meanwhile everybody is having a snack. The ideally a scenario is to have it mean world where no lunch time because it's a prescience 1 hour time that we cool reviews for the proposed of sharing knowledge.
The benefits from this session cool sounds a little bit redundant but he's really good to highlight then one more time:
Allows engineers to be in the comfort zone of talking about technologies de demain and expose the benefits that cool get abducted for helping on Wells Fargo.
Also, besides giving importunity to everybody to participate, it helps a lot to break the ice on dusting members that they do not participate a lot on Enterprise meetings.
Coupling programming: It will sound similar to what is play programming but if we went to make the note that is quite different. Pair programming as described in Xtreme Programming methodology, it is something which is is a strictly done in some way, and Coupling Programming we define it as a session where the 2 or many developers could have their own machines and deliver code independently while sharing knowledge with the other peers.
The session is going to be helpful and there is a good tool for increasing interaction across team members an increasing the sharing knowledge of the same time, also it could work as a good alternative for avoiding Silo knowledge.
